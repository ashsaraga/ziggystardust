# IN CASE OF EMERGENCY
There's no reason to expect Ziggy should need special care, but in an emergency here's what I'd do:
 
  1. if life-threatening, Mandarin has an pet Emergency Room and hotline: **904-268-4118**;
  2. next, or if not life-threatening, call Ash or Ryan;
  3. if Ash and Ryan are both unreachable, and the issue is urgent, try calling her vet at **904-694-0541**;
  4. if the issue is non-urgent, and seems like it can wait a while, wait for Ash or Ryan to call back.

# Care & Upkeep 

## Food, Schedule, & Quantity 
Ziggy's food sitch is pretty simple, same thing morning and night, and it's all in the left-most cabinet of the island, top shelf.  She uses the same water bowl as Leela, and her food bowl lives on the bottom shelf of the printer cart.

### Morning || Evening 
  - time: 0815 || 1815
  - amount: 1 scoop || 1 scoop
  - food: dry kibble || dry kibble

## Litter Box 
_Ideally_ you shouldn't have to do anything with the litter box, but just in case, I've left **two cat litter buckets nearby: one has the scoop, poop bags and such, the other is actually just cat litter.**  If it starts to get smelly, incense does a good job of masking the scent.

## Ziggy Makes a Mess 
Ziggy's been pretty good about using the cat box, but every once in a while decides to relieve herself elsewhere, most often in piles of clothing.  Not really sure why yet, but regardless, **there's a red spray bottle of "Nature's Miracle" under the kitchen sink** that's safe on most surfaces and will breakdown the cat odors as it cleans.
